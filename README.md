This project is an introductory data analysis of bike sales across different countries and brands during the years 2013 and 2014. The goal of this project was to explore sales trends, identify top-performing products, and understand the distribution of sales across customer segments. This analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel for data preparation and Power BI for visualization.

## Project Overview

In this project, we analyzed the following key aspects of bike sales:
- Total sales and profit by product

### Key Elements of the Dashboard

1. **Product Sales and Profit Table**: A summary table that shows the total sales, profit, and quantity sold for each product type. 
   - **Top products by sales**: Paseo, VTT, and Velo.
   
2. **Sales by Segment (Pie Chart)**: A pie chart displays the breakdown of sales by customer segment, including Government, Small Business, Enterprise, Midmarket, and Channel Partners. This helps us understand which segments contribute most to bike sales.
   
3. **Yearly Sales and Profit (Line Chart)**: A line chart that shows the growth of sales and profit from 2013 to 2014, illustrating an upward trend in both metrics.
   
4. **Sales by Country (Bar Chart)**: A bar chart that compares sales volumes across different countries. This helps identify the countries with the highest demand for bikes.
   
5. **Geographical Sales Distribution (Map)**: A map visual showing the geographic locations of sales, helping visualize where the sales are concentrated across different regions.

## Insights

- **Top Selling Products**: "Paseo" is the highest-selling bike product, with significant profit margins, followed by "VTT" and "Velo".
- **Customer Segment Distribution**: The largest share of sales comes from the Enterprise and Midmarket segments, which together contribute to over 75% of total sales.
- **Yearly Growth**: Both sales and profit show a positive trend from 2013 to 2014, indicating growth in the market.
- **Country-wise Sales**: The highest sales volumes are recorded in countries with codes "Un", "Ca", and "Fr", which might correspond to the United States, Canada, and France, respectively.

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for initial data cleaning, preparation, and preliminary analysis.
- **Power BI**: Used to create an interactive dashboard to visualize trends and insights.
